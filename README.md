# pallet-example-transitive
A simple "hello-world" Forklift pallet illustrating transitive layering of pallets

## Introduction

pallet-example-transitive is a [Forklift](https://github.com/PlanktoScope/forklift) pallet defined
as an override layer over
[github.com/forklift-run/pallet-example-layering](https://github.com/forklift-run/pallet-example-layered).
Specifically, this pallet adds a Dozzle app which is not present in
github.com/forklift-run/pallet-example-layering.

## Usage

### Prerequisites

You will need to have the Docker Engine installed on your computer. Installation instructions are
available [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).

Then, you will need to set up the [`forklift`](https://github.com/PlanktoScope/forklift) tool on
your computer. Setup instructions are available
[here](https://github.com/PlanktoScope/forklift?tab=readme-ov-file#downloadinstall-forklift). Note
that currently `forklift` is only tested for Linux computers.

### Deployment

You can clone the latest commit of this Forklift pallet to your computer, by
using the `forklift` tool:
```
forklift plt clone github.com/ethanjli/pallet-example-transitive@main
```

Then you can apply the cloned pallet on your computer using the following sequence of `forklift`
CLI commands:
```
sudo -E forklift plt apply
```

Warning: this will replace all Docker containers on your Docker host with the package deployments
specified by this pallet and delete any Docker containers not specified by this pallet's package
deployments.

If your user is in the `docker` group (so that you don't need to use `sudo` when running `docker`
commands), then you can just run a single command instead of the two commands listed above:

```
forklift plt switch github.com/ethanjli/pallet-example-transitive@main
```

This pallet will bring up a web server at port 80.
- If you open <http://localhost/hello> in your web browser after deploying the pallet, you should
  see an NGINX page which prints some basic information such as the current date.
- If you open <http://localhost/whoami>, you should see a blank page - this is because this pallet
  imports the simple-demo package deployment from github.com/forklift-run/pallet-example-layered
  which overrides the configuration from github.com/forklift-run/pallet-example-minimal to remove
  the `/whoami` route.
- If you open <http://localhost/admin/prometheus>, you should see a basic Prometheus query console -
  this is because this pallet imports the package deployment for Prometheus from
  github.com/forklift-run/pallet-example-layered, which imports the package deployment from
  github.com/PlanktoScope/pallet-standard.
- If you open <http://localhost/admin/grafana/d/host-summary/host-summary?orgId=1&refresh=5s>, you
  should see a Grafana dashboard with system monitoring information about your computer - this is
  because this pallet imports the package deployment for Grafana from
  github.com/forklift-run/pallet-example-layered, which imports the package deployment from
  github.com/Planktoscope/pallet-standard.
- If you open <http://localhost/admin/dozzle/>, you should see a Dozzle dashboard with a list of
  containers running on your computer - this is because this pallet imports the package deployment
  for Dozzle from github.com/Planktoscope/pallet-standard.

### Forking

To make your own copy of this repository for experimentation, you should fork this repository to a
new repository. Then, update the `path` fields of the `forklift-pallet.yml` and
`forklift-repository.yml` files to match the path of your new repository.
